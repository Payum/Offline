# Get it started.

In this chapter we are going to talk about offline payments. The offline may be used in case of cash, cheque or wire transfer.
We assume you already read [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) from core.
Here we just show you modifications you have to put to the files shown there.

## Installation

The preferred way to install the library is using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
Run composer require to add dependencies to _composer.json_:

```bash
php composer.phar require payum/offline
```

## config.php

Let's modify `config.php` a bit.

```php
<?php
//config.php

use Payum\Offline\PaymentFactory as OfflinePaymentFactory;

// ...

$offlineFactory = new OfflinePaymentFactory();
$payments['offline'] = $offlineFactory->create();
```

## prepare.php

Here you have to modify a `paymentName` value. Set it to `offline`.
